# Module 6 Challenge - Kyle Albright

## User Story / Acceptance Criteria
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

```

## Usage

When the user is presented with the app, they can input a city to search for weather. If the user does not enter a city an alert will prompt them to enter a valid city. Once the user inputs the city, they are presented with a current weather forecast that includes, the date, city they selected, temperature, wind conditions, and humidity percentage, and an icon depicting the current weather. Additionally, a 5 day forecast will be displayed below the current weather data. The user from this point can search for a new city. The previous search history will be saved in a list of buttons below the search bar, so that they may reference previous searches.
